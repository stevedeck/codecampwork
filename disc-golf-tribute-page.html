      <ul>
        <li>An early version of disc golf was played in Canada where friends would throw a frisbee into a bucket</li>
        <li>Modern disc golf has roots across several states in the 1960s</li>
        <li>The game is simple - throw the frisbee/disc into a basket. The number of throws is your score. Lowest score wins!</li>
      </ul>
